## **Download & Run🔧📦**

> **This software its compatible with all Operative System with Java 11+**

### **Download**
You can download the last WAR version to deploy in Tomcat9: [Releases Page](https://github.com/rudahee/MyBookListBackend/releases). 

You only need download the last version stable: `MyBookList-v.1.0-STABLE.war`.

_If you don't want to go to the releases page every time, there is a shortcut on the right with the latest version available_

### **Execution**

To run the application you must deploy on a Tomcat9 or similar server, for this you can have more information about it in the documentation tutorial.
Alternative, you can run the app doing java -jar (I recommend do a daemon in linux).
